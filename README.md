# Rock/Paper/Scissors-Game
My first ever Python project.
It is a simple Python3 code of the famous game "Rock, Paper and Scissors".
The game is played against the computer.
The code simply takes input from the user and compares it to a randomly generated value from the computer and then displays the result of a win or a loss.
The game then shows total victory and losses at the end of the code.
It even gives the overall result of victory or loss.
